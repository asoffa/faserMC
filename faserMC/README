Geant4 must be installed, here assumed to be in /some/path/geant4/geant4-install.

To build and run, create build and run directories next to the checked out source directory:

/path/to> source /some/path/geant4/geant4-install/bin/geant4.sh
/path/to> mkdir build run
/path/to> ls
build faserMC run
/path/to> cd build
/path/to> cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/some/path/geant4/geant4-install/lib64/Geant4-10.4.0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/run ../faserMC
/path/to/build> make
/path/to/build> make install
/path/to/build> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/run/lib
/path/to/build> cd ../run

Then, to run interactively use this command (running with no command line argument triggers interactive mode):

/path/to/run> bin/faser

while to run in batch mode, use

/path/to/run> bin/faser init_novis.mac outputFile.root

"init_novis.mac" is a sample batch macro file.  The only thing you may want to change is the number of events (/run/beamOn command).

"outputFile.root" is the name of whatever file you want the root Tree written to.

In either case, the mass of the Aprime is set in the macro file faserPhysicsList.mac.  You can't change the name as it's hard-coded to read at job-startup time.
